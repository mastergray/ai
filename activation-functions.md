# Activation Functions

In deep learning, activation functions are mathematical functions applied to the output of each neuron in a neural network layer. They introduce non-linearities to the network, allowing it to model complex relationships and make more accurate predictions.

Activation functions determine whether a neuron should be activated (fire) or not based on the weighted sum of its inputs. They introduce non-linearity because they transform the input values in a non-linear way. Without activation functions, a neural network would be limited to representing only linear transformations, severely restricting its modeling capabilities.

Activation functions can be classified into two types:

1. **Linear Activation Functions**: These functions produce a linear transformation of the input, which means they don't introduce non-linearities. Linear activation functions are rarely used in deep learning because stacking multiple linear transformations would result in an overall linear transformation.

2. **Non-linear Activation Functions**: These functions introduce non-linearities to the neural network. They allow the network to learn and approximate complex, non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. Some common non-linear activation functions used in deep learning include:

    1. **Sigmoid**: The sigmoid function maps the input to a value between 0 and 1. It was widely used in the past but has fallen out of favor in many applications due to issues like vanishing gradients and output saturation.

    2. **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: ReLU returns 0 for negative inputs and passes positive inputs directly. ReLU is popular because it is computationally efficient and helps alleviate the vanishing gradient problem.

    3. **Leaky ReLU**: is a variation of ReLU that introduces a small negative slope for negative inputs, preventing the dead neuron problem that can occur with ReLU.

    4. **Tanh**: The hyperbolic tangent function, or tanh, maps the input to a value between -1 and 1. Tanh is similar to the sigmoid function but has a range that is symmetric around 0.

    5. **Softmax**: The softmax function is commonly used in the output layer of a neural network for multi-class classification problems. It takes a vector of real numbers as input and outputs a probability distribution over the classes, ensuring that the probabilities sum up to 1.

The choice of activation function depends on the problem at hand and the properties of the data. It is common to use ReLU or one of its variants as the activation function in most hidden layers of deep neural networks, while softmax is often used in the output layer for classification tasks.

## Sigmoid

The sigmoid function, also known as the logistic function, is a widely used non-linear activation function in deep learning. It maps any real-valued number to a value between 0 and 1, which makes it suitable for problems involving binary classification or representing probabilities.

The sigmoid function is defined as:

```
f(x) = 1 / (1 + exp(-x))
```

In this equation, **x** is the input to the function. The function calculates the exponential of the negative **x**, denoted as exp(-x), and adds 1 to it. Then, it takes the reciprocal of this sum, which gives the output of the sigmoid function, f(x).

The sigmoid function has the following properties:

1. **Output Range**: The output of the sigmoid function is always between 0 and 1. As 'x' becomes large and positive, the output approaches 1, and as 'x' becomes large and negative, the output approaches 0. This property makes it suitable for problems where the output needs to be interpreted as a probability or a binary decision.

2. **S-Shaped Curve**: The sigmoid function has an S-shaped curve, which means it starts with a gentle slope near the origin, followed by a steeper slope in the middle, and then a gentle slope again as it approaches the upper limit. This property makes it differentiable and suitable for gradient-based optimization algorithms used in training neural networks.

3. **Non-Linearity**: The sigmoid function introduces non-linearity to the network, allowing it to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs. This non-linearity is crucial for the expressive power of neural networks, enabling them to approximate arbitrary functions.

Despite its historical popularity, the sigmoid function is less commonly used in deep learning for hidden layers. It suffers from the issue of vanishing gradients, which can slow down the training process in deep neural networks. It tends to saturate for extreme input values, causing the gradients to become very small, which hampers the learning process.

However, the sigmoid function is still used in some scenarios, such as the output layer of a binary classification problem where the output needs to be interpreted as a probability between 0 and 1.

### Example Implementation

In Python, you can implement the sigmoid function using the numpy library. Here's an example of how you can define and use the sigmoid function:

```python
import numpy as np

def sigmoid(x):
    return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-x))

# Example usage
x = 2.5
output = sigmoid(x)
print("Sigmoid output:", output)
```

In this example, the `sigmoid` function takes an input `x` and returns the output of the sigmoid function calculated as `1 / (1 + exp(-x))`. The numpy library's `exp` function is used to calculate the exponential of `-x`.

You can use the `sigmoid` function to compute the sigmoid of any real-valued number `x`. In the example above, the sigmoid of `x = 2.5` is calculated and stored in the `output` variable. Finally, the result is printed to the console.

Make sure to have the `numpy` library installed in your Python environment to use the necessary functions. You can install it using `pip install numpy`.

Remember that the sigmoid function is useful for mapping real-valued numbers to values between 0 and 1, typically used in scenarios such as binary classification or as activation functions in neural networks.

## ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)

ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is a popular activation function used in deep learning. It introduces non-linearity to the network and helps alleviate the vanishing gradient problem. ReLU is defined as follows:

```
f(x) = max(0, x)
```

In this equation, 'x' represents the input to the function, and the function outputs the maximum value between 0 and 'x'. In other words, ReLU passes positive input values directly, while setting negative values to 0.

ReLU has the following properties:

1. **Activation Threshold**: ReLU has an activation threshold at 0. Any input value greater than 0 is activated and passed through, while any negative value is set to 0. This threshold behavior allows ReLU to introduce non-linearity to the network. It makes the network capable of learning complex relationships and capturing the presence or absence of certain features.

2. **Computational Efficiency**: ReLU is computationally efficient compared to other activation functions that involve more complex mathematical operations, such as exponentiation. The ReLU function involves only a simple comparison and selection of the maximum value.

3. **Sparse Activation**: ReLU tends to produce sparse activation patterns in neural networks. Since it sets negative values to 0, only a subset of neurons in a network may be activated at a given time, resulting in a sparse representation of the input. This sparsity can enhance the network's efficiency and interpretability.

ReLU has become a popular choice for activation functions in deep learning because of its simplicity, computational efficiency, and ability to address the vanishing gradient problem. However, it should be noted that ReLU can also suffer from a potential issue called "dying ReLU." If a neuron's output gets stuck at 0 during training, it may cause the gradient to be zero and prevent the neuron from learning. To mitigate this, variants of ReLU, such as Leaky ReLU and Parametric ReLU, have been introduced.

ReLU is typically used as the activation function in the hidden layers of deep neural networks, while a different activation function, such as softmax or sigmoid, may be used in the output layer based on the nature of the problem being solved.

### Example Implementation

Implementing the ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function in Python is straightforward. Here's an example of how you can define and use the ReLU function:

```python
def relu(x):
    return max(0, x)

# Example usage
x = -2.5
output = relu(x)
print("ReLU output:", output)
```

In this example, the `relu` function takes an input `x` and returns the output of the ReLU function, which is the maximum value between 0 and `x`. The `max` function is used to compare the values and select the maximum.

You can use the `relu` function to compute the ReLU activation of any real-valued number `x`. In the example above, the ReLU activation of `x = -2.5` is calculated, and the result is stored in the `output` variable. Finally, the result is printed to the console.

Note that the ReLU function sets negative input values to 0, effectively removing the negative values and passing only the positive values or zero. This introduces non-linearity to the network, allowing it to learn complex relationships and address the vanishing gradient problem.

Keep in mind that the implementation above is a basic version of ReLU and does not handle arrays or tensors as inputs. For efficient computation on large datasets, you may want to utilize libraries like NumPy or TensorFlow, which provide vectorized operations for element-wise ReLU activation on arrays or tensors.

Also, be aware that in practice, it is common to use optimized implementations of ReLU provided by deep learning frameworks, such as `tf.keras.layers.ReLU()` in TensorFlow or` nn.ReLU()` in PyTorch, as they offer additional functionalities and optimizations for training deep neural networks.

## Leaky ReLU

Leaky ReLU is a variation of the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function that addresses the "dying ReLU" problem. The dying ReLU problem occurs when a ReLU neuron gets stuck at a negative value during training and fails to recover, effectively rendering the neuron inactive. Leaky ReLU introduces a small slope for negative input values, allowing a small gradient to flow through and preventing neurons from dying.

The Leaky ReLU function is defined as follows:

```
f(x) = max(a * x, x)
```

In this equation, **x** represents the input to the function, and **a** is a small positive constant, typically set to a small value like 0.01. The function outputs the maximum value between **a * x** and **x**. If **x** is positive, Leaky ReLU behaves like ReLU and passes the input directly. If **x** is negative, Leaky ReLU allows a small gradient (**a**) to flow through, proportional to the input **x**.

The main advantage of Leaky ReLU over ReLU is that it prevents neurons from becoming completely inactive by introducing a non-zero output for negative inputs. This helps to mitigate the dying ReLU problem and promotes better gradient flow during training, which can lead to improved learning and convergence.

In addition to the standard Leaky ReLU, there are variants that introduce even more flexibility, such as Parametric ReLU (PReLU), where the slope 'a' is learned during training for each neuron individually, allowing the network to adaptively determine the best slope for each neuron.

### Example Implementation 

To implement Leaky ReLU in Python, you can define a function that applies the Leaky ReLU activation to a given input. Here's an example implementation:

```python
def leaky_relu(x, alpha=0.01):
    return max(alpha * x, x)
```

In this implementation, the `leaky_relu`function takes an input `x` and an optional parameter `alpha`, which represents the slope for negative values. By default, `alpha` is set to `0.01`, but you can adjust it as needed.

Note that this implementation is for a single input value. If you want to apply Leaky ReLU to arrays or tensors, you can use libraries like NumPy or TensorFlow, which provide vectorized operations. For example, using NumPy, you can apply Leaky ReLU to a NumPy array like this:

```python
import numpy as np

x = np.array([-2.5, 1.0, -0.5])
output = np.maximum(0.01 * x, x)
print("Leaky ReLU output:", output)
```

In this case, the NumPy `maximum` function is used to element-wise compare the values of `0.01 * x` and `x`, selecting the maximum at each element of the array. The resulting array contains the Leaky ReLU activations for each corresponding input element.

## Tanh

The hyperbolic tangent function, commonly known as Tanh, is an activation function that maps the input to a value between -1 and 1. It is a sigmoidal function that introduces non-linearity and is widely used in deep learning models.

The Tanh function is defined as follows:

```
f(x) = (e^x - e^-x) / (e^x + e^-x)
```

In this equation, **x** represents the input to the function, and **e** denotes the base of the natural logarithm.

Here are some key properties of the Tanh function:

1. **Range**: The Tanh function's output ranges from -1 to 1, which makes it suitable for capturing both positive and negative patterns. The input values close to 0 are mapped near 0, while large positive or negative values are mapped to +1 or -1, respectively.

2. **Symmetry**: The Tanh function is symmetric around the origin (0, 0). This means that f(-x) = -f(x), which can be useful in certain scenarios where symmetry is desired.

3. **Smoothness**: The Tanh function is a smooth function that is differentiable over its entire domain. It has a continuous derivative, which makes it suitable for gradient-based optimization algorithms used in training deep learning models.

4. **Zero-centered**: The Tanh function is zero-centered, as its output is 0 when the input is 0. This can be advantageous in certain applications, as it helps with the convergence of optimization algorithms by allowing positive and negative updates.

The Tanh function is commonly used as an activation function in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and as a squashing function in certain types of autoencoders. It introduces non-linearity to the network, allowing it to model complex relationships and capture both positive and negative patterns in the data.

### Example Implementation

Here's an example of how you can compute the Tanh function in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

def tanh(x):
    return np.tanh(x)

# Example usage
x = 2.5
output = tanh(x)
print("Tanh output:", output)
```

In this example, the `tanh` function takes an input `x` and uses the `np.tanh` function from the NumPy library to compute the Tanh activation. The result is stored in the `output` variable and then printed to the console.

## Softmax

Softmax is an activation function that is commonly used in the output layer of a neural network for multiclass classification problems. It takes a vector of real numbers as input and outputs a probability distribution over multiple classes.

The softmax function calculates the probabilities for each class by exponentiating the input values and normalizing them. The formula for softmax is as follows:

```
softmax(x_i) = e^(x_i) / (sum(e^(x_j)) for j in range(num_classes))
```

In this equation, **x_i** represents the i-th element of the input vector, and **num_classes** is the total number of classes. The softmax function exponentiates each element of the input vector, making them positive, and then divides each exponentiated value by the sum of all exponentiated values in the vector.

The resulting softmax output is a probability distribution over the classes, where each value represents the probability of the corresponding class. The probabilities sum up to 1, ensuring that the output represents a valid probability distribution.

The softmax function has the following properties:

1. **Probability Distribution**: The softmax function converts the input values into a valid probability distribution, where each value represents the probability of a specific class. This makes it suitable for multiclass classification tasks.

2. **Normalization**: Softmax normalizes the input values by exponentiating and dividing them by the sum of exponentiated values. This normalization ensures that the output probabilities are in the range of 0 to 1 and sum up to 1.

3. **Monotonicity**: The softmax function is monotonically increasing, meaning that increasing the input values will also increase the corresponding output probabilities. However, the softmax function amplifies the differences between input values, leading to more confident predictions.

Softmax is often used in combination with the cross-entropy loss function for training multiclass classification models. The output probabilities from softmax can be compared to the one-hot encoded target labels using the cross-entropy loss to compute the model's error and update the network's parameters during training.

### Example Implementation

Here's an example of how you can compute the softmax function in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

def softmax(x):
    exp_vals = np.exp(x)
    return exp_vals / np.sum(exp_vals)

# Example usage
x = np.array([2.0, 1.0, 0.5])
output = softmax(x)
print("Softmax output:", output)
```

In this example, the `softmax` function takes an input array `x` and uses NumPy functions to exponentiate the input values, compute their sum, and divide each exponentiated value by the sum. The resulting softmax output is stored in the `output` variable and then printed to the console.
